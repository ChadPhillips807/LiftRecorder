TODO: Find out where and why we add DbContext to the Controller. This may have been the issue last night. Example in Vidly CustomerController.cs
-- He does this to get a list of customers from the database.. I don't need a list of -- users from the database. I need a list of the current users recent lifts. Should -- gstart by getting just the last lifting session by using the date field

-- private ApplicationDbContext _context;

-Add Data to LiftTypes DB -- DONE
-Add data to Lifts DB -- DONE
-Add data to AppUsers DB
-Add data to UsersLifts DB

//Update the LiftTypeDB
Sql("INSERT INTO LiftTypes (Name) VALUES ('Chest')");
Sql("INSERT INTO LiftTypes (Name) VALUES ('Back')");
Sql("INSERT INTO LiftTypes (Name) VALUES ('Legs')");
Sql("INSERT INTO LiftTypes (Name) VALUES ('Shoulders')");
